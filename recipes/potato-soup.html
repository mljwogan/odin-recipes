        <li>Add oil to a Dutch oven on medium-high heat</li>

        <li>Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a seperate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and basil</li>
        <li>Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream mixture to the potato mixture; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Transfer about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and puree. Return to the Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
