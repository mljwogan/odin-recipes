<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
  It's always good to try something new ... like ground pok instead of beef in your tacos!
  The flavour is somewhat reminiscent of al pastor tacos, but ready in a fraction of the time from scratch.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<h3>Tacos:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon soy-based liquid seasoning</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>8 small/medium tortillas</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pineapple Salsa:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 cup diced fresh pineapple</li>
    <li>1/4 cup minced red onion</li>
    <li>1 small jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh basil</li>
    <li>1/2 lime, juiced</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Combine ground pork, liquid seasoning, ground chipotle powder, and garlic in a bowl. Set aside for flavours to meld.</li>
    <li>Combine pineapple, red onion, jalapeno, basil, lime juice, and salt in a bowl.
        Set pineapple salsa aside.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat a large skillet over high heat. Crumble ground pork into the hot skillet. Cook and stir until pork is completely browned and edges begin to crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain any excess grease. Place pork in a bowl and keep warm. Wipe out skillet.</li>
    <li>Warm tortillas in skillet over medium-low heat, about 20 seconds per side.
        Divide meat mixture between tortillas and top with pineapple salsa.
    </li>
    <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cook's Note:</h3>

<p>
    If you cannot find any soy-based liquid seasoning, you can combine equal parts soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce.
